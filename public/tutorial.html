        <h1>Who are we?</h1>
    <div class="tekst"> 
        <p> 
            We are Jelke, Vincent, Joran, Joost, Folkert, Wilfried and Raymon and we were put together as a group for the course Introductieproject of the bachelor Computer Sciences Department of Universiteit Utrecht.</p>
        <p>
            The goal of this course was not only to develop a piece of software that solves a real-world problem, but also to learn how to work self-dependent and autonomously as a team. By experiencing the advantages, disadvantages and potential problems of working in a team on a software product, we should learn how to work better in a team and use this experience for in the future.</p>

        <h1>What do we do?</h1>
    <div class="tekst"> 
        <p> 
            For our software project we chose the following problem:<br>
            In the first grades of high school almost everyone takes a biology course. Within this course there are multiple subjects handled among which the subject of evolution. Evolution can often be seen as a vague concept for high school students, hence it is often misunderstood or downright denied. The thing that students most often struggle with is how evolution causes (new) species to be created or how evolution makes it able for species to adapt to their environment.</p>
        <p>
            Biology teachers find it difficult to explain this concept to students without using examples. Most of the time they make up a story to create some sort of image of how evolution works. But this does not guarantee that all students will understand the concept, because the imagination of students differs.
            <br><br>
            So, in a broad sense we want to explain evolution in a straightforward, more visual and easily digestible way. Specifically, we want to focus on making it easier to see the bigger picture of how small mutations eventually cause evolution.</p>

    <h1>What is "The Hexagon Of Life"?</h1>
    <div class="tekst"> 
        <p> 
            The Hexagon of Life is a computer program that should make it easier for teachers to educate their students about the concept of evolution. With the help of our program the students should be able to digest the material explained and handled in the classes about evolution easier. 
            <br><br>
            Our program simulates an environment in which evolution takes place. The environment consists of a map on which food is spawn and creatures are roaming. Creatures can be herbivore (a zebra) or carnivore (a lion). To create a visualization of the evolution we gave each creature his own genes which returns into characteristics that can be seen when roaming on the map.
</p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, when a creature mates with another creature a child will be breed. The genes of the child will be the average of the parents' genes. Unless mutation occurs when passing over the genes of the parents. The occurrence of mutation in the genes is random and this creates a lot of variation in genes between the different creatures. The variation in genes will be visualized by the characteristics of a creature that can be seen on the map.
            <br><br>
            To make the program more user-controlled and to not only create a visualization of evolution, but to also create more understanding. There is a settings page added in which the students can change many parameters that have influence on the simulation. Because of this, teachers can challenge their students by making it possible to create many different simulations which can then be compared by using the statistics out of the statistics page.
